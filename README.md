## About Me

I'm a Data Scientist focused on building production-ready AI solutions that solve real business problems. My work spans time-series forecasting, computer vision, and Generative AI systems—from concept to deployment. 

Currently, I specialize in developing intelligent agents and RAG-based systems that combine retrieval accuracy with reasoning capabilities. My recent projects have delivered measurable impact: 67% trading signal accuracy (vs 41% baseline), 15-20% inventory optimization, and 90%+ accuracy in computer vision pipelines.

## What I'm Working On

- **Agentic AI Systems**: Building multi-agent workflows with LangGraph and LangChain for complex reasoning tasks
- **RAG Architectures**: Designing retrieval-augmented generation systems that integrate vector databases with MCP web search
- **Time-Series Forecasting**: Developing causal pattern analysis frameworks for financial and supply chain applications
- **Computer Vision**: End-to-end pipelines for object detection and OCR using YOLOv8 and PaddleOCR
