## About Me

I am a Data Scientist with hands-on experience delivering real-world ML solutions as an intern at Rubixe Technology Limited. I specialize in building, evaluating, and deploying predictive models that solve high-impact business problems.

My expertise spans both traditional ML and modern AI applications, including time series forecasting, NLP, and deep learning. From EDA and feature engineering to model optimization and deployment, I focus on end-to-end pipeline delivery with measurable outcomes.

## What I Do

- Build scalable machine learning pipelines using Python and industry-standard libraries  
- Perform in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering  
- Forecast trends and optimize inventory with time series models like Prophet and ARIMA  
- Design NLP applications for sentiment analysis and customer feedback mining  
- Deploy AI systems using FastAPI, Streamlit, and Docker  
- Collaborate cross-functionally to translate data into actionable insights

## Featured Projects

### [Spare Parts Demand Forecasting](https://github.com/Prabhuteja124/Inventory-Demand-Forecasting)  
Forecasted daily and weekly demand using Prophet, ARIMA, and SARIMA. Helped improve inventory planning by reducing forecast error.

### [Sentiment Analysis NLP](https://github.com/Prabhuteja124/Sentiment-Analysis-NLP.git)  
Built a real-time sentiment classifier using TF-IDF, RidgeClassifier, and FastAPI. Included robust testing with pytest and model packaging with joblib.

### [Employee Performance Prediction](https://github.com/Prabhuteja124/Employee-Performance-Analysis.git)  
Achieved 94% accuracy using LightGBM. Handled SMOTE, PCA, and full ML pipeline for performance classification.

### [Texas Salary Prediction](https://github.com/Prabhuteja124/Texas-salary-prediction)  
Used XGBoost (R² = 0.856) to predict salaries of state employees. Focused on model explainability and deployment-readiness.

## Career Goals

- Advance skills in Deep Learning, NLP, and MLOps  
- Contribute to production-grade AI systems  
- Collaborate on impactful open-source and client-based projects  
- Become a versatile Data Scientist bridging statistical rigor with software engineering
