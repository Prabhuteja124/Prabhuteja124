# Prabhu Teja

## About Me

I am a Data Scientist and AI Engineer with a strong foundation in mathematics, machine learning, and deep learning. My work focuses on building scalable machine learning systems that deliver measurable results. I specialize in transforming raw data into predictive models, deploying AI-powered applications, and developing solutions that align with real-world business needs.

I take pride in building end-to-end systems — from data exploration and model development to deployment and monitoring. Whether it’s a regression model for salary prediction, a classification system for customer churn, or a time series forecasting tool for inventory optimization, I focus on both precision and production-readiness.

## What I Do

- Build and optimize machine learning models for structured data problems  
- Develop AI applications using TensorFlow, Keras, and deep learning workflows  
- Handle full ML pipelines: data cleaning, feature engineering, validation, and tuning  
- Create interactive dashboards and insights using Power BI, Tableau, and Seaborn  
- Deploy ML models using Flask, Streamlit, and Docker  
- Apply time series forecasting techniques to real-world demand problems

## Featured Projects

**[Texas Salary Prediction](https://github.com/Prabhuteja124/Texas-salary-prediction)**  
Developed a regression model using XGBoost (R² = 0.856) to predict state employee salaries. Focused on feature importance, model evaluation, and deployment-readiness.

**[Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/Prabhuteja124/Churn-Analysis-project)**  
Built a classification model that achieved 84% recall using SMOTE and logistic regression. Evaluated against multiple ensemble models.

**Customer Transaction Prediction**  
Designed a multi-stage ML pipeline to predict customer transactions, including class balancing, threshold tuning, and feature optimization.

**Spare Parts Demand Forecasting (In Progress)**  
Forecasting service center inventory using SARIMA and Prophet models. Emphasis on temporal decomposition and model performance (RMSE, MAE).
